As such consumer communication is driven by leveraging audience data by selecting specific messages and offers. At the same time, distribution across various advertising channels is streamlined. This improves media and audience planning capabilities and yields a significant increase in media efficiency for TUI fly. Our clear goal was to select a partner with experience in delivering a holistic solution which smoothly integrates into the existing marketing infrastructure. Also, the ability to provide professional support and service were key criteria for the selection process.
